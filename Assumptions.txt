Assumptions
=============
It is assumed that Node.js is installed on a Windows-operating system.

The following libraries are needed to run the Zoom kiosk. 
 - HTTP
 - Robotjs
 - QR-image
 - FS
 - Express

However, setup script can be run using the setup powershell script or running the command 'npm install' within the containing directory.


The variables on the start.js file may need to be changed. 
++++++++++++++++++
IP refers to the IP of the operating system on the network - is needed to listen to requests
ExternalIP makes up the string for the QRCode, referring to a website or IP.
QRPort directs website traffic
callRequestPort listens to Zoom call requests
personCalled is the search string used to identify the person being called.

Port forwarding and access to the server from an external point is also assumed.

People can only be called if they are on the callers contact list as well.
